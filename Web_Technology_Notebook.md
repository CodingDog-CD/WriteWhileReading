## How does HTTPS work?
Use HTTPS to protect microservices.

<b>Prerequisites</b>
You need to trust that public key cryptography & signature works:
1. Any message encrypted with Bob's public key can only be decrypted with Bob's private key
2. Anyone with access to Alice's public key can verify that a message (signature) could only haven been created by someone with access to Alice's private key

## openssh
openssh can be used to login another machine. </br>
When you use linux, you can carry out the following command after installing openssh:
```ssh username@hostname```

then you should be required to give a password for authentication.
That's it!
