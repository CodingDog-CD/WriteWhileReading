## How does HTTPS work?
Use HTTPS to protect microservices.

<b>Prerequisites</b>
You need to trust that public key cryptography & signature works:
1. Any message encrypted with Bob's public key can only be decrypted with Bob's private key
2. Anyone with access to Alice's public key can verify that a message (signature) could only haven been created by someone with access to Alice's private key
