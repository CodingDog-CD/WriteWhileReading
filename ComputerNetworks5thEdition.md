### Web
HTML CSS - Create Web pages

Static Web Page VS Dynamic Web Page

To achieve dynamic web page, there are several approaches. Some basic technologies: PHP (control server side program), JavaScript (Control client side program in browser)

<b>AJAX (Asynchronous JAvascript and Xml) - Many full-featured Web applications, such as Google's Gamil, Maps, and Docs, are written with AJAX </b>
- HTML and CSS to present information as pages
- DOM (Document Object Model) to change parts of pages while they are viewed
- XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to let programs exchange application data with the server
- An asynchronous way for programs to send and retrieve XML data
- JavaScript as a language to bind all this functionality together

<b> Design Pattern: </b>
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).
